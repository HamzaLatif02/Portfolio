                    <h3> Hamza Latif</h3>
                    <p>  Hey, my name is Hamza Latif.</p>
                    
                    <p> I grew up in Italy and in 2018 I moved to London. So far it has been a great oppurtunity for me to learn and improve myself. </p>
                    
                    <p> I first started learning how to code in Italy 6 years ago, with C++ as my first language. I didn't learn much at that stage but it set the foundation to my coding journey. I spent the last two years learning VB.net as part of my A-Levels course, while learning the basics of Python in my own free time. </p>
                    
                    <p> I am currently studying towards a BSc in Computer Science at City, University of London. </p>
